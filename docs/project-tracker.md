# CS2 AI Coaching Project Tracker

## Project Stages
1. Repository setup and planning
2. Resource collection and technical exploration
3. Input pipeline selection and state representation
4. First prototype implementation
5. Recommendation generation and evaluation
6. Final refinement and presentation preparation

## Individual Contributions So Far
- **Zichen Mi**: organized the repository, updated the README, and prepared the meeting documents including the check-in summary and project tracker.
- **Haozhe Zhu**: contributed to project planning, technical direction discussion, and exploration of CNN / YOLO and scene-understanding related ideas.
- **Bohan Shi**: contributed to project discussion on demo-based pipeline ideas, recommendation direction, and possible prototype setup.

## Immediate Next Actions
- finalize repository documents for the TA check-in
- confirm short-term team responsibilities
- collect and organize technical resources
- decide the most practical first implementation direction
- prepare to explain progress, scope, and questions during the meeting
