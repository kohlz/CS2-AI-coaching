# CS2 AI Coaching Project Tracker

## Project Stages
1. Repository setup and planning
2. Resource collection and technical exploration
3. Input pipeline selection and state representation
4. First prototype implementation
5. Recommendation generation and evaluation
6. Final refinement and presentation preparation
